Blueprint Hackathon project:

We wanted our project to not reflect our dreamy mindsets but to reflect each level of our team members. It was Mickey's first time coding so she spent a lot of her time understanding the code. She had many ideas for her games but had a hard time combining each part of the game. Jesse had a little more experience than the rest and wanted to create a website using HTML. Due to the time constraint, he couldn't import the python scripts into the HTML before the deadline. Daniel focused all his time getting his tic-tac-toe perfectly. Though he is a beginner, he is a master of what he created. Emi wanted to design a user-interactive Hangman that generated a word from a large list of random words that was aesthetically pleasing. We hope this website brings the simplest joy and pastime. A place where you can relax and take a breather but not too long to procrastinate. In the future, we hope to add many more games and features that we couldn't today.
